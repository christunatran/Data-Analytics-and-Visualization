### a. What website you scraped, for what kind of products?
I scraped IMDb.com for reviews of the top 50 most popular Anime movies and TV shows.

### b. How you designed your scraping?  How you selected a list of products on the site?
I used IMDb's 'refine' tool to sort the top 50 movies and TV shows tagged with the keyword "Anime" by popularity. Then, I fetched the URLs of the review pages for each of those movies/shows in a list. I parsed the web page's HTML code and crawled through each of the movies/shows pages by iterating through the list of URLs I created to scrape my desired data fields comprised of the review data. I stored the associated review data (title, author, date, etc.) in lists which I then combined in one dataframe to convert to a csv format.

### c. How you minimized your impact on the targeted website?
I made sure to be conscious of the ethical issues and cautions associated with scraping, such as denial-of-service attacking the website and/or disrupting their service. I spread my scraping out over time, in 30 second intervals, using time.sleep().

### d. Any challenges you encountered and how you addressed them?
A challenge I encountered was properly identifying which lines of HTML code were associated with the visuals and text I required to do my scraping. I found it helpful to use my browser's "inspect element" tool which allowed me to quickly highlight each web page element by hovering over its respective code, so that I knew which tags and classes to look for when performing my scraping.
