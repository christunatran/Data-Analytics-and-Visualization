## Question
Is review 'helpfulness' ratio a good indicator for review sentiment?

## Rationale
With a countless number of movies and TV shows to choose from, people often use online reviews to narrow down which ones they should watch. As it turns out, there are also countless numbers of reviews to sift through for almost every media, especially the popular ones. 'Helpful' ratings allow users to anonymously vote on whether or not a particular review is helpful, and signaling if it is worth reading to others. Something that I'm curious about is the basis upon which people cast this vote, and whether it is influenced by the review content's sentiment, (i.e. positive or negative word-choice). Perhaps this analysis can uncover a pattern that leads users to vote a certain way for the reviews they read, and help inform myself on how to write more effective reviews that others find helpful.

# Step 1:
### Data
The data source is 'https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword/?keywords=anime', which is up to date as of November 1, 2020. It contains the most popular most popular Anime movies and TV shows from IMDb, a popular rating/review site. In Homework 8 I scraped the data for the top 50 most popular entries with requests and parsed with BeautifulSoup. I have loaded the data as a pandas DataFrame below.


```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('Homework08.csv')
data.head()
```

# Step 2:
## Processing
Since we now have our data, the columns we are mainly interested in are the 'Review Text' and 'Helpfulness'. To begin analyzing the text sentiment of these reviews, we create a bag of words from every one. We clean the review data by removing punctuations and whitespace, and converting everything to lowercase.


```python
text = data['Review Text']
text = text.str.lower() # convert to lowercase
# replace punctuation with white space
text = text.str.replace(',',' ').str.replace('.',' ').str.replace('!', ' ')
text = text.str.replace('?', ' ').str.replace(':', ' ').str.replace(';', ' ') 

bag = [t.split() for t in text] # create bag of words for each review 
```

Then, we load in the lists of positive and negative words to compare to our bags of words for every review. We see that in the list, there are more negative than positive words.


```python
# load in positive and negative bags of words
positives = set(open('positive.txt').read().split())
positives
negatives = set(open('negative.txt').read().split())
negatives

len(positives), len(negatives) # more negative words than positive words
```




    (1913, 3351)



We iterate through every sub-list, or bag of words, for each review to compare with the positive and negative word lists. We create a list of the number of positive and negative words found in each review.


```python
# compare with reviews
# iterate through every list in the bag and perform the comparison
p = [] # list of number of positive terms in reviews
n = [] # list of number of negative terms in reviews
total = [] # list of total number of words in review
for i in range(len(bag)):
    p.append(len([w for w in bag[i] if w in positives]))
    n.append(len([w for w in bag[i] if w in negatives]))
    total.append(len(bag[i]))
```

Then, we create a 'Helpfulness Ratio' column in the tab by extracting the two numbers from the 'Helpfulness' column rows, then compute the ratio by dividing them.


```python
help_text = data['Helpfulness']
help_text = help_text.str.replace(' out of ', ' ').str.replace(' found this helpful.', '').str.replace(',', '')
split = [w.split() for w in help_text] # split extracted numbers into list entries

# convert list entries from string to int
help_int = []
for i in split:
    help_int.append(list(map(int, i)))

import numpy as np
    
ratio = []
numerator = [] # helpfulness rating numerator
denominator = [] # helpfullness rating denominator
for i in help_int:
    numerator.append(i[0])
    denominator.append(i[1])
    if i[1] != 0:
        ratio.append(round( ((i[0] / i[1]) * 100),2) )
    else:
        ratio.append(np.NaN)

# clean up to fill blank rows with column mean  
ratio = pd.Series(ratio)
ratio = ratio.fillna(round(ratio.mean(),2))
```

Next, we create a DataFrame containing our new data. There is an addition of a 'Sentiment' column which determines whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral sentiment by comparing the number of positive and negative words found in them. We also included columns of the numbers of positive and negative words, as well as review length.


```python
analysis = pd.DataFrame({
    "Title": data['Title'],
    "Helpfulness Ratio": ratio,
    "Review Text": data['Review Text'],
    "# Positive Words": p,
    "# Negative Words": n,
    "Review Length": total
})

analysis['Sentiment'] = np.where(analysis['# Positive Words'] == analysis['# Negative Words'], 'Neutral', 
                                 np.where(analysis['# Positive Words'] > analysis['# Negative Words'], 'Positive', 'Negative'))
analysis
```

# Step 3:
## Analysis
Now that we have our data processed and organized, we can begin making visualizations and perform analysis to better understand it. First, we create a pie chart to look at the proportions between positive, negative, and neutral sentiment reviews. There appears to be a large majority of positive-sentiment reviews, despite the initial positive word list containing less words than the negative word list.


```python
analysis.Sentiment.value_counts().plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.0f%%')
```




    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x2a6170ea668>




![png](output_14_1.png)


Next, we can plot the distribution of helpfulness ratios across all of the reviews. We can see that the data is skewed toward higher ratios-- suggesting that users found most reviews helpful.


```python
# plot distribution of helpfulness ratios
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
analysis['Helpfulness Ratio'].plot.hist(bins=5)
```




    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x2a616c85dd8>




![png](output_16_1.png)


Going back to our original question, "Is review 'helpfulness' ratio a good indicator for review sentiment?" We can look at the correlation between the number of positive and negative words in a review with its helpfulness ratio. In this case, scatterplots were used to visualize this relationship and a Pearson correlation coefficient was computed.


```python
p_plot = analysis.plot.scatter(x='# Positive Words', y='Helpfulness Ratio')
```


![png](output_18_0.png)



```python
analysis['# Positive Words'].corr(analysis['Helpfulness Ratio'])
```




    -0.04646573184116434




```python
n_plot = analysis.plot.scatter(x='# Negative Words', y='Helpfulness Ratio')
```


![png](output_20_0.png)



```python
analysis['# Negative Words'].corr(analysis['Helpfulness Ratio'])
```




    -0.12205978769724478



Based off of the scatterplots and the pearson correlation test, there appears a very weak-to-no correlation between positive/negative sentiment and helpfulness ratio of reviews.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, there does not seem to be a definitive correlation between review text sentiment and helpfulness rating. 

A limitation of our approach is that reducing the 'helpfulness' column to a percentage neglects the total number of votes a review received. Some had 353 and others had only 3. This leads to potentially skewed data because of different sample sizes. The data collection also provided disproportionate amounts of positive, negative, and neutral reviews, with a heavy majority of positive reviews. This approach only looks at the sentiment-heavy words to try to determine what makes others find a review helpful. It would be interesting to look at the other words, such as stop-words, since these positive and negative-labeled words only comprise a fraction of the entire review.  Perhaps the determiner for helpfulness lies more in the actual content and readibility of the review, which requires more complex analysis.
